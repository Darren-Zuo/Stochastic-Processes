## About

if you understand Chinese, it would be a remiss if you didn't watch this lecture. It's not the usual mathematical derivation setting, but filled with many other stuffs, like finance, artificial intelligence (diffusion MODEL) and stuff.

## Textbooks

Papoullis - Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes (solution manuals is also included) <br>
Samuelson - Economics (Worth reading if you're interested in Finance, option pricing in this book is related to Brownian Motion)<br>
张颢， 陆大全 - 随机过程及其应用(1st & 2nd edition)<br>
张颢 - 概率论
